# Station Chief - Development Progress

## Session 2 (2026-01-12)

### Task: sc-002 - Configure development tooling

Successfully configured the complete development tooling infrastructure for the project.

#### Implementation Summary

1. **ruff.toml** - Created configuration file for linting and formatting
   - Line length: 100 characters
   - Target Python version: 3.11
   - Selected rules: E, W, F, I, C, B, UP, ARG, SIM, RUF
   - Configured isort integration for import sorting
   - Added flake8-bugbear FastAPI immutable calls configuration

2. **pyproject.toml** - Enhanced mypy configuration
   - Added strict mode settings: disallow_any_generics, disallow_untyped_calls
   - Added no_implicit_optional and warn_unused_ignores
   - Module overrides for alembic and gitpython (missing imports)

3. **conftest.py** - Pytest configuration
   - Added pytest markers for slow and integration tests
   - Configured async test support (asyncio_mode = "auto" in pyproject.toml)

4. **tests/test_placeholder.py** - Sample test file
   - Tests package imports
   - Tests version attribute existence
   - Verifies test infrastructure is working

5. **Makefile** - Development commands
   - `make lint` - Run ruff linting checks
   - `make format` - Format code with ruff
   - `make typecheck` - Run mypy type checking
   - `make test` - Run pytest with coverage
   - `make install` - Install project with dev dependencies
   - `make dev` - Run lint, typecheck, and test
   - `make clean` - Remove build artifacts and cache

#### Feedback Loop Results

All checks pass successfully:
- ✓ Linting: ruff found no issues in 8 files
- ✓ Type checking: mypy found no issues in 6 source files
- ✓ Formatting: All 8 files formatted correctly
- ✓ Tests: 2 tests passed with 100% code coverage

#### Key Learnings

- ruff.toml structure: Top-level settings come before [sections]
- ruff.toml [format] section has limited options (use top-level line-length instead)
- Mypy needs module overrides for untyped third-party packages (alembic, gitpython)
- pytest async mode "auto" is configured in pyproject.toml, not conftest.py
- Project already had partial development setup in pyproject.toml (pytest.ini options, tool configs)

#### Files Created/Modified

Created:
- ruff.toml
- conftest.py
- tests/test_placeholder.py
- Makefile

Modified:
- pyproject.toml (enhanced mypy configuration)

All tools are now ready for development. The project has a solid foundation for code quality checks.
