## Session: sc-009 - CHECKPOINT: Foundation complete (2026-01-12)

### Summary
Successfully validated Phase 1 foundation. All 8 validation steps pass with no blockers.

### Validation Results
1. ✓ Server starts with uvicorn factory pattern
2. ✓ Health endpoint returns 200 OK with version
3. ✓ CLI commands work (--version, config show)
4. ✓ Docker Compose setup functional
5. ✓ GitHub Actions CI pipeline configured
6. ✓ All 42 tests pass with 88% coverage
7. ✓ Linting passes (ruff)
8. ✓ Type checking passes (mypy)

### Key Findings & Fixes
- **Greenlet dependency missing**: Added greenlet>=3.0.0 to pyproject.toml
  - Required when using aiosqlite + async SQLAlchemy with run_sync() bridge
  - SQLAlchemy needs greenlet for async/sync thread bridging
- **Typer extra issue**: Fixed typer[all]>=0.9.0 → typer>=0.9.0
  - typer 0.21.1 doesn't have an [all] extra
  - Typer already includes Click dependency

### Project Status
- All feedback loops pass locally
- Docker environment verified working
- CLI fully functional with config system
- Database initialization working with migrations ready
- CI/CD pipeline configured and ready

### Ready for Phase 2
The Phase 1 foundation is solid. No blocking issues identified.
Ready to proceed with Phase 2 implementation.
