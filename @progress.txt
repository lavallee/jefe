### Key Findings & Fixes
- **Greenlet dependency missing**: Added greenlet>=3.0.0 to pyproject.toml
  - Required when using aiosqlite + async SQLAlchemy with run_sync() bridge
  - SQLAlchemy needs greenlet for async/sync thread bridging
- **Typer extra issue**: Fixed typer[all]>=0.9.0 → typer>=0.9.0
  - typer 0.21.1 doesn't have an [all] extra
  - Typer already includes Click dependency

### Project Status
- All feedback loops pass locally
- Docker environment verified working
- CLI fully functional with config system
- Database initialization working with migrations ready
- CI/CD pipeline configured and ready

### Ready for Phase 2
